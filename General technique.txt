Considerations
? Does the call to the remote system require Salesforce to wait for a response before
continuing processing? In other words, is the call to the remote system a
synchronous request-reply or an asynchronous request?
? If the call to the remote system is synchronous, does the response need to be
processed by Salesforce as part of the same transaction as the initial call?
? Is the message size relatively small or large?
? Is the integration based on the occurrence of a specific event, such as a button click
in the Salesforce user interface, or DML-based events?


What are the patterns that can be used?
Does this need to be real-time or batch?
What are the platform limits?

Deployment:

Considerations
? What deployment tool can be considered?
? Do you need to consider a fully custom solution?
? Can we use existing ANT tasks to fulfill some parts of the requirement?
? Can we find an option without real development?
